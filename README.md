# AppleScriptBackup
A simple backup script written in bash/AppleScript that will allow you to automate your Time-Machine backups, and shut the computer down when the backup is finished.


# How to Run:

1. Make sure you have a valid Time Machine disk (HFS, or Mac OS Extended/ Ex. Journaled) with space to perform TM backups
2. Make sure Terminal has accessability access. This is needed so the applescript can shut down apps.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is and run **backupsh.sh**. 

Note: If you want to view/verify progress has been made in the backup, you can enable "Show Time Machine in Menu Bar" in the Time Machine Preferences. 

4. Wait for the Time Machine to finish, and the computer to shut down.
